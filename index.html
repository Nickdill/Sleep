                    Sleep is controlled by a roughly 90 minute cycle, that goes back and forth between REM 
                    (Rapid Eye Movement) and NREM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. A large reason that contributes to people
                    waking up tired is their misunderstanding of this cycle and how and what sleep does overall.
                    Sometimes, you may feel fine after 6 hours of sleep, and at other times sleeping for 7 hours might make you 
                    extra tired in the morning. This is because you should always try to sleep for increments of 90 minutes 
                    to avoid waking up in the middle of a REM cycle, when your brain is in the middle of a deep stage of sleep.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, your body has something called a circadian rhythm. It is your biological clock that operates based on
                    a roughly 24 hour cycle, and is infuenced by stimuli such as light. It has developed in every animal to 
                    adjust for Earth's rhythmic day and night cycle. Predators for example only eat during the day when 
                    prey is awake, so they sleep at night when they cannot see or hunt efficiently. The stimuli that affect 
                    you circadian rhythm are called Zeitgebers or "time givers", as they are responsible for setting your
                    natural clock and listening for cues to sleep. 
                    <br><br>
                    Jet lag is a phenomenon that occurs quite regularly and shows how your circadian rhythm 
                    really is 24 hours. You body will be incredibly tired even though it may be the middle of the day,
                    because your biological clock has already begun to release Melatonin which tells your brain you are
                    ready to sleep. Melatonin pills have therefore become a popular sleep aid, and unfortunately are
                    used by many people daily. Melatonin pills however are not a good solution to sleep disorders, as your
                    body naturally secretes it, and therefore will secrete less and less naturally as you become more reliant.
                    Melatonin is instead meant to aid those suffering the affects of jet lag, or those who need to adjust their 
                    biological clock.

                    Sleep is a very difficult subject to study, and there are many questions about it that are still
                    unanswered. However, there are many amazing benefits that have been proven, and many unbelievable
                    ideas and creative inventions as a result of sleep.

                    John Lennon of the Beatles, found the tune of "Yesterday" in a dream and it became one of their
                    most successful songs.

                    Dmitri Mendeleev struggled to organize the known elements into a organized structure, until he fell asleep in
                    1869 and dreamed of a new column/row structure organizing the elements by atomic weight. This became the
                    Period Table of Elements we use today.

                    The professional golfer Jack Nicklaus was in a bad slump, routinely shooting in the high seventies.
                    In his sleep he dreamed of a different swing. He tried it out the next day, and then he shot a
                    65 and 68 over the next two days.
                    <br><br>
                    It can be difficult to understand how this process works, but sleep has seen the creation of many
                    creative ideas.

                    Many people are used to sleeping minimal amounts every night, and do not notice any consequences. 
                    <span class="content-3"></span> Anything less than 7 or 8 hours can lead to serious consequences, and those who pull 
                    all-nighters or those who pull all-nighters multiple nights in a row must be made aware of the 
                    unseen damage they are doing to themselves.
                    <br><br>
                    First, sleep loss can make you sick. If you do not sleep a healthy amount, your immune system will take
                    the hit and you will find yourself becoming sick more often. The World Health Organization has
                    even declared shift work a probably carcinogen. Besides that, sleep is correlated with metabolism. 
                    Studies have shown that glucose tolerance (efficiency/speed of clearing glucose from blood) 
                    can be impaired by over 40% after sleep loss. This is a level similar to those who are at 
                    significantly greater risk of diabetes. Additonally, subjects who do not sleep a healthy amount 
                    have altered amounts of Leptin and Ghrelin, hormones that control hunger. This means if you don't 
                    get full sleep not only are you risking cancer, sickness, and diabetes, but you will probably 
                    gain weight as well.

                    Andre Iguodala is an NBA MVP, All-Star and Olympian who has actually measured his performance after 
                    sleep. He found that after 8+ hours of sleep, he had a 29% increase in points per minute, 9% increase in
                    free throws, played 12% longer in games, and had 45% fewer fouls and 37% fewer turnovers. These are big numbers
                    and the difference was a full night of sleep.
                    <br><br>
                    There is science behind this too as sleep consolidates and enhances memories, which includes the procedural memory or that
                    of a skill. Not only is sleep beneficial for memory consoldation, but it is absolutely necessary within the first 
                    24 hours of learning before deprivation has its affects.
                    <br><br>
                    Declarative memory, or that of facts, also benefits from sleep and memory consolidation. For declarative 
                    memories, this consolidation takes place during deep slow wave sleep stages of NREM. It is a popular idea
                    that people have to get a good night of sleep before a test or big day, and it has been supported with
                    many studies.
